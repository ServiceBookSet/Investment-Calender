# Investment-Calender
This is an interactive investment planning tool that implements a "invest when market falls" strategy.
# Core Functionality
Investment Strategy:
Invest a base amount (default ₹1000) only when the market falls compared to the previous trading day
When market doesn't fall, the amount accumulates (carries over to next day)
When market falls, the entire accumulated amount is invested, then reset to base amount
